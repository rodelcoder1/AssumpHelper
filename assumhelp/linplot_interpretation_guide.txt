Linearity Plot (Residuals vs Fitted Values)

If the plot shows a random scatter of points around the horizontal axis with no clear curve, the relationship between the predictors and the outcome is linear.
> The assumption of linearity is NOT VIOLATED.

If the plot shows a curve or systematic pattern in the scatter of points, the relationship between the predictors and the outcome is not linear.
> The assumption of linearity is VIOLATED.

Always double check with the RESET test.
