Normality Plot (Q–Q Plot)

If the points lie close to the straight diagonal line, the residuals behave normally.
→ The assumption of normality is NOT VIOLATED.

If the points deviate strongly from the line (curving, bending, or forming an S-shape), the residuals are not normal.
→ The assumption of normality is VIOLATED.

Always double check with the Shapiro–Wilk test.
